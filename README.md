# Collaborative Air Hockey Robot 🤖🏒

**Master's Thesis Project**

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a collaborative robotic system designed to play air hockey against a human opponent. The project combines computer vision, object tracking, trajectory prediction, and real-time robot control using ABB's Externally Guided Motion (EGM) interface.

The system uses a vision pipeline to detect the puck and predict its motion. Based on the predicted trajectory, the robot reacts either defensively or offensively to intercept or hit the puck back.

## 🔧 Key Features

- 🎯 Real-time puck detection and tracking using OpenCV
- 📈 Trajectory prediction algorithm with bounce handling
- 🧭 Perspective correction based on ArUco marker detection
- 🤖 Support for both simulation and real robot via ABB RobotStudio + EGM
- 🖼️ Visual debugging and mask display during gameplay

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV (aruco, image processing)
- NumPy
- Pillow (for screen capture in simulation)
- pypylon (Basler camera SDK)
- ABB EGM SDK (socket-based communication)

## ⚙️ How to Run

### Requirements

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pypylon Pillow
```

### Hardware Setup
- Connect a Basler camera
- Setup ABB robot with RobotWare and enable EGM communication
- Calibrate the table using ArUco markers (IDs 0,1,2,3)

### Execution

```bash
python v5_egm_ABBRobotEGM_lib.py
```

- If ArUco markers are not detected, a manual ROI selection will be prompted.
- For simulation, set `camera_real = False` in the script.
