# Collaborative ABB Robot as an opponent in the Air Hockey Game

This repository contains the code for detecting and predicting the trajectory of an air hockey puck, developed as part of my diploma thesis. The system processes camera input (either real or simulated) to track the puck, predict its movement, and communicate with a robot for real-time interaction.




## Features

- Air Hockey puck tracking
- Live trajectory prediction
- Simulation / Real
- EGM
