# Collaborative ABB Robot as an opponent in the Air Hockey Game

This repository contains Python code for detecting and predicting the trajectory of an air hockey puck, developed as part of my diploma thesis. The system processes camera input (either real or simulated) to track the puck, predict its movement, and communicate with an ABB robot for real-time interaction.

In addition to the Python script, the repository includes a RobotStudio simulation environment for testing and simulating the entire system. This allows you to experiment with the detection and prediction models in a virtual environment before deploying them to the physical robot.
